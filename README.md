# SBA 308: JavaSript Fundamentals
## Project description
This project applies fundamental JavaScript concepts in a practical manner. My goal is to analyze and transform a set of data such that the output of my program is an array of objects with a given format. For this purpose, I have created a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. 


### The following requirements are part of this assessment:
- Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate.
- Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.
- Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables.
- Use at least two if/else statements to control program flow.
- Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.
- Utilize at least two different types of loops.
- Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue.
- Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.
- Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.
- Use functions to handle repeated tasks.
- Program outputs processed data as intended.
- Program runs without errors.

## Technologies used
- JavaScript
